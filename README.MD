# QR Code Generator

This Python project generates a QR code from a provided URL and optionally resizes the image. The generated QR code and resized images are saved in an `output` directory.

## Features

- Generate a QR code from any URL.
- Resize the generated QR code to a specified width while maintaining aspect ratio.
- Automatically saves output files in the `output` directory.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. Additionally, you need to install the required Python libraries.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository or download the files:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/qr-code-generator.git
   cd qr-code-generator
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

You can run the script directly from the command line. The script takes in a URL and generates the corresponding QR code.

### Basic Command

```bash
python qr_maker.py "https://example.com"
```

This command will generate a QR code for `https://example.com`, resize it to 500 pixels wide, and save the images in the `output` folder as `qr_code.png` and `resized_qr_code.png`.

### Advanced Usage

You can customize the output filenames and resized image width using optional arguments:

```bash
python qr_maker.py "https://example.com" --output "output/my_qr_code.png" --resized_output "output/my_resized_qr_code.png" --width 400
```

- `--output` specifies the file name for the generated QR code (default: `output/qr_code.png`).
- `--resized_output` specifies the file name for the resized QR code (default: `output/resized_qr_code.png`).
- `--width` specifies the width of the resized QR code image in pixels (default: 500).

### Example

```bash
python qr_maker.py "https://example.com" --output "output/website_qr.png" --resized_output "output/website_qr_resized.png" --width 300
```

This command will generate a QR code for `https://example.com`, save it as `website_qr.png`, resize it to 300 pixels wide, and save the resized image as `website_qr_resized.png` in the `output` folder.

## Output

All generated images will be saved in the `output` directory.
